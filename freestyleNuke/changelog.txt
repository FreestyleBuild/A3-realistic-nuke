Changelog:


Version 0.4.1:

Bug fixes to damage and sound effects.

Changed/Fixed:

- airblast20psi.sqf
	- does no longer hide objects which are invulnerable
	- now properly affects all buildings

- fireFX.sqf
	- soudn randomization added/fixed



Version 0.4.0 Craters:

The Explosion now creates a crater.


New:

- Added crater.sqf
	- a crater will be created by the explsoion
	- depending a its size its either a single object or multiple stones aranged in a circle, with debris at the center
	- the crater does not disappear, it can be used to block terrain like roads are airfields
	- if the bomb detonates above groudn level the crater will be smaller


Changed/Fixed:

- airblast20psi.sqf
	- will now hide objects close to the center to allow for the creation of the crater
	
- mushroomcloud.sqf
	- small tweaks and fixes foe the effects
	
- fireFX.sqf
	- small changes to sound effects, shoudl now have for variations

- iniNuke.sqf
	- now calls crater.sqf and calculates the radius of the crater



Version 0.3.0 Fire and Effects:

Some buildings are set on fire after the explosion, changes to particles, small fixes and the code has been slighty cleaned up.


New:

- Added iniFire.sqf
	- some buildings will be set on fire by the detonation
	- fires deal damage to units who get to cloase and slowly destroy the burning building itself
	
- Added fireFX.sqf
	- particle effects for the new fires
	

Changed/Fixed:

- airblast5psi.sqf
	- now starts fires using iniFire.sqf, those fires last 5 to 6 minutes
	- fixed bug with division by zero error occuring due to vehicle with mass 0
	
- blastwave.sqf, falloutParticle.sqf, mushroomcloud.sqf, flash.sqf
	- various tweaks to particle colors and other particle properties
	- fixed a bug where the mushroomcloud stem persisted longer than it cap
	
- radioation500rem.sqf, radioation5000rem
	- fixed typo in code
	- minor change to damage calculation in radioation500rem.sqf
	
- iniNuke.sqf
	- changed arguments passed to mushroomcloud.sqf and flash.sqf to alter size of said effects
	- nuclear fallout now lasts 900 seconds instead of 300 (5 minutes instead of 3)
	
- (almost) all files
	- deleted unused code, cleaned up code
	- some comments



Version 0.2.1:

Blast waves now throw away units and vehicles, some bug fixes.


New:

- airblast5psi.sqf, airblast20psi.sqf
	- vehicles are now thrown back (distance depending on their mass) and are flipped sideways
	- units are thrown back and down to the gound (they are set to prone stance)
	
	
Changed/Fixed:

- airblast1psi.sqf, airblast5psi.sqf, airblast20psi.sqf
	- units that go prone receive less damage and are not thrown back (20 psi blastwave is still always lethal)
	- fixed bug where units/vehicles/buildings at the margin of the 5 psi zone were always completely destroyed instead of just receiving damage
	- fixed bug which coused 20 psi shockwave to affect all objects instantly, now it should properly expand



Version 0.2.0:

Added fallout and new particles. Fixed some bugs with the lighting, particles and damage.


New:

- Added nuclearWaste.sqf
	- after detonation nuclear waste is spread around the ground zero
	- units within this area are damaged every few seconds
	- you can negate the effect by wearing a CBRN suits and a breathing mask, thanks to user "the Cheshire" for the idea
	
- Added falloutParticle.sqf
	- particle effects for the fallout effect and near the center of the blast, thanks to user "jushdrug" for the suggetsion
	
	
Changed/Fixed:

- airblast1psi.sqf, airblast5psi.sqf, airblast20psi.sqf, radioation500rem.sqf, radioation5000rem.sqf, thermal50.sqf, thermal100.sqf, jamming.sqf
	- fixed a bug where units and vehicles objects where not selected correctly, thanks to user "Mikey74" for reporting this
	- some minor changes in the damage stats
	- units with damage disabled shoudl no longer to damaged by any effect, again thanks to "Mikey74" 
	
- condensationRing.sqf, blastwave.sqf, mushroomcloud.sqf
	- minor changes to particle effects
	- fixed a bug with small mushroomclouds having to few particles

- flash.sqf
	- reduced brightness and increased flare size to avoid glitches, thanks to user "jushdrug" for reporting this
	
- iniNuke.sqf
	- updated to use the new scripts
